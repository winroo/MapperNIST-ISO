# MapperNIST-ISO
This script helps to map your controls from NIST 800 53 to ISO 27001 and vice versa.

The mapping is based on the NIST document https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-53/rev-5/final/documents/sp800-53r5-to-iso-27001-mapping.docx
Please, read the notes in the document to fully understand the precision of the mapping which is limited by mapping in this document.
